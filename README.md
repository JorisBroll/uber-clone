Naveco is a private driver company (like Uber or Lyft) located in Lyon.

To estasblish themselves on the Internet, they needed an application modeled on existing apps, as well as a back office to manage their rides remotely take bookings via a phone operator.

Two mobile applications (a driver, a customer) communicated with the server continuously to book, quote and pay for a ride, and then assign that ride to a nearby driver.
